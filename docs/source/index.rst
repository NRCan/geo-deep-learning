Welcome to Geo Deep Learning documentation!
===========================================

The geo-deep-learning project stems from an initiative at
`NRCan's CCMEO <https://natural-resources.canada.ca/science-and-data/science-and-research/geomatics/10776>`_.
Its aim is to allow using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and other 
deep-learning methods with georeferenced datasets.

Check out the :doc:`quickstart` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.

.. note::

   This project is under active development.
